# api-viacep
The purpose of this project was to practice data consumption from an API and perform processing of the returned data. The specific goal was to obtain information such as address, city, and state based on a postal code (CEP in Portuguese). The information was captured and inserted into the registration form. In this project, I also practiced handling simple errors within the given context.
